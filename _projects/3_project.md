"Oxygen Forensic® Detective also supports parsing of Google Fit, Fitbit, and Samsung Health apps."

"Oxygen Forensic® Detective is not intended for direct smartwatch extraction via cable. Smartwatches have limited data storage so their data is typically synchronized with a paired device, which Oxygen Forensic® Detective will extract data from. .  In cases where there is no access to a paired device, a direct extraction from a smartwatch becomes important. Let us know if a direct smartwatch extraction is vital for your investigation."
