Hello, I am a computer scientist since 2001.
I studied at the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. 
Since then i have been interested in IT security and IT networks.
I worked for about four years as an IT security employee at an large insurance company.
I worked with firewalls, routers and VPNs.
Then I worked for five years as a manager for the IT infrastructure of the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
The work included the tasks of running a data centre with security devices and many remote locations.

> Since 2021 my focus has been on Android smartphone forensics

Due to restructuring, I moved to the forensic area in 2015.
At first I was afraid that the forensic topics would be very limited.
Coming from the wide range of network topics, I was initially unable to recognise
the diversity of the topics in the forensic area.
I worked in Windows forensics and Linux forensics for five years.
Then I had the opportunity to work in network forensics. 
The rise of smartphones led me to move into smartphone forensics.
After three years and a steady increase of topics, 
I was able to focus on Android smartphones.
