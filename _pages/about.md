[Ludwig-Maximilians-University]: https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html "https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html"

I have been a computer scientist since 2001.
I studied at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University] in Munich.
Since then I have been interested in IT security and IT networks.
I worked for about four years in the IT security department of a large insurance company.
Among other things, I was responsible for planning firewalls, routers and VPNs.
I then worked for five years as an IT infrastructure manager for the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
This involved running a data centre with security equipment and remote sites.

> Since 2021, my focus has been on Android smartphone forensics

Due to a restructuring, I moved to the IT forensics department in 2015.
At first I was afraid that the IT forensic topics would be very limited.
Coming from the wide range of networking topics, I was initially unable to see
the diversity of topics in IT forensics.
I worked in Windows forensics and Linux forensics for five years.
Then I had the opportunity to work in network forensics.
The rise of smartphones led me to move into smartphone forensics.

After three years and a steady increase in topics,
I was able to focus on Android smartphones and Android smartwatches.
