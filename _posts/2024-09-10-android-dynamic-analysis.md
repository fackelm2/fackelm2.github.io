dynamic analysis

Dynamic analysis refers to the observation and recording of an app's behaviour during its execution 
in order to collect runtime data.

Dynamic analysis is particularly useful for observing the actual behaviour of the app 
in a controlled environment and identifying artefacts generated by specific user interactions or runtime scenarios.
