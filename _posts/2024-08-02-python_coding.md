[Python Variables]

In this article:

"This article will give you all the understanding of Python variables you need to use them effectively in your
projects."

"Download the Python variables cheatsheet"

```
country = "Germany"
federal_states = 16
```

- "Variables in Python are case-sensitive.
  - in other words, watch your casing when creating variables,
  - because **Year_Founded** will be a different variable than **year_founded** even though they include the same
    letters"
- "Variable names that use multiple words in Python should be separated with an underscore \_
  - for example, a variable named **"site name"** should be written as **"site_name"**
  - this convention is called snake case (very fitting for the "Python" language)"
