## App Gmail

cmdg - A command line client to GMail

"cmdg is a commandline client to GMail that provides a UI more similar to Pine/Alpine.
It uses the GMail API to interact with your mailbox. This has several benefits."

Security Problems using the normal Web UI

"GMail web UI uses username and password to log in, which means they can be stolen. You should be using U2F Yubikeys, so that losing the password isn't as big of a deal. The user has to re-type the password every now and then, which is an opportunity for the attacker to steal the password."

"OAuth token in cmdg.conf can be copied, and the thief would be able to access the users GMail until the key is revoked. The access does not expire on its own."
