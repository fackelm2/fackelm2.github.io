## Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a digital currency (digital money) based on cryptographic processes
and usually managed in a decentralised manner via a blockchain.

## Hardware Wallet

A hardware wallet is required to securely store private keys for cryptocurrencies
offline. The main advantage is its separation from the internet
(→ 'cold storage'), which means it cannot be compromised by malware or
remote attacks, unlike software wallets or exchanges.

- Security
  - Private keys never leave the device (source: Ledger Whitepaper)
  - Protection against keyloggers, phishing and remote access
- Independence
  - Full control over your own assets ('Not your keys, not your coins')
- Support for multiple signatures and passphrases
  - Additional layers of security possible
- Consistency
  - Independent of compromised computers or mobile devices.

[Ledger] is one example of a hardware wallet for storing cryptocurrencies securely.
It provides a secure environment for managing private keys and signing transactions,
ensuring that your digital assets are protected from online threats.

The Ledger Nano S Plus and Ledger Nano X are two popular models that provide
robust security features, including secure chip technology and a user-friendly
interface.

Hardware for cryptocurrency wallets (for example [Ledger Shop])

- Ledger Nano S Plus (with a small display and no Bluetooth)
- Ledger Nano X (with a small display and Bluetooth)
- Ledger Flex (with a small display and no Bluetooth)
- Ledger Stax (with a large display and a touch screen)
