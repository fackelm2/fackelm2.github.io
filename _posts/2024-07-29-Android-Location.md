Google Location Data

How can I export my Location History now that this data is only stored locally on the phone?

Google has been migrating phones to only store Location History data locally on the phone. Once an account has been transitioned, you can no longer export the data using Google Takeout since it is no longer on Google servers.

How can I export my Location History data after my account as been transitioned?

"Go to the settings app, then 
Location->Location Services->Time Line->Export Timeline Data 
and pick a folder and filename to export to. 
Wait a little while and then go check the folder and a new JSON file with your complete location history should be there."

Credit to vijaykes for finding this (I would have never found this new option on my own)...
