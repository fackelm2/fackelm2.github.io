## What is Android Keystore?
"Android provides a number of mechanisms to protect user data. Data is almost always encrypted at rest through schemes 
such as Full disk or File-based encryption. Features like user lock screens and app sandboxing also serve to protect 
user data contained in apps from unauthorized access or extraction. However, all of these protections can be defeated 
in certain circumstances and app developers may choose to add a layer of security at the application layer."
