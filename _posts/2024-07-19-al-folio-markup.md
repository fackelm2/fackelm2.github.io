What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions for indicating formatting in 
email and usenet posts. It was developed by John Gruber (with help from Aaron Swartz) and released in 2004 in the 
form of a syntax description and a Perl script (Markdown.pl) for converting Markdown to HTML. In the next decade, 
dozens of implementations were developed in many languages. Some extended the original Markdown syntax with 
conventions for footnotes, tables, and other document elements. Some allowed Markdown documents to be rendered in 
formats other than HTML. Websites like Reddit, StackOverflow, and GitHub had millions of people using Markdown. 
And Markdown started to be used beyond the web, to author books, articles, slide shows, letters, and lecture notes.
