"This time it's going to be about BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth stack. Note that there are other Bluetooth stacks for Linux such as BTstack, but I didn't find the time to play around with these, and BlueZ is still what you get these days if you install a normal Linux distribution."

raspberry pi with broken network or firewall config."
