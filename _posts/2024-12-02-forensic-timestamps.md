## Forensic Timestamps
A very helpful article to get MAC timestamps of FFS Extractions 

"Full File System extractions in Zip - MAC times
How do zip files generated by extraction tools used in digital forensics manage file timestamps?"

"In order to validate the MAC times on these particular FFS extractions one can use the following python script: extract_timestamps.py
Script location: https://github.com/abrignoni/Misc-Scripts/
The script needs the path to the FFS extraction and the path internal to the zip for the file which you would like to see the associated MAC times."
