Welcome to Playground

Enter an instruction or select a preset, and watch the API respond with a message that attempts to match or answer the query.

You can control which model completes your request by changing the model.
Keep in mind
Use good judgment when sharing outputs, and attribute them to your name or company. Learn more.
Requests submitted to our API and Playground will not be used to train or improve future models. Learn more.
Each models' training data cuts off at a different time. Our newest models have knowledge of many current events up to October 2023. Learn more.

ChatGPT API with Python code

https://community.openai.com/t/how-do-i-call-chatgpt-api-with-python-code/554554

Better. Set environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to your key, and at a command shell get the latest library:

````
pip install --upgrade openai
````

````
#!pip install --upgrade openai  # uncomment for Jupyter installing
import openai as oa;cl=oa.OpenAI();cc=cl.chat.completions.create(
messages=[
{"role": "system", "content": "You are FunnyBot"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "relevant: farts exert force"}, # RAG
{"role": "user", "content": "Do penguin farts propel?"}
], stream=True, max_tokens=420, top_p=.69, model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
print(*(ck.choices[0].delta.content or "" for ck in cc), sep="", end="")
````

In addition to the Documentation and API reference there is the cookbook: https://cookbook.openai.com/. I presume there
are good tutorials on YouTube but I don’t use them. Maybe others can recommend.

````angular2html
import requests
import json
import os

openai_api_key = # put yout api key here
if openai_api_key is None:
raise ValueError("OpenAI API key is not set in environment variables.")

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"Authorization": f"Bearer {openai_api_key}"
}

data = {
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
      {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
  {
    "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello!"
    }
  ]
  }

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
print("Response from OpenAI:", response.json())
print('\n')
print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
else:
print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
