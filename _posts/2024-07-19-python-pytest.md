Troubleshooting Pytest Error: 
````markdown
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 
````

Solution: use the PYTHONPATH env. var

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54895002/modulenotfounderror-with-pytest

````markdown
PYTHONPATH=. pytest

As mentioned by @J_H, you need to explicitly add the root directory of your project, 
since pytest only adds to sys.path directories where test files are (which is why @Mak2006's answer worked.)
Good practice: use a Makefile or some other automation tool

If you do not want to type that long command all the time, one option is to create a Makefile in your project's root dir with, e.g., the following:

.PHONY: test
test:
    PYTHONPATH=. pytest

Which allows you to simply run:
make test
